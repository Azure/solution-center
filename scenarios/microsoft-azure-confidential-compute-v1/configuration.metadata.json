    "overviewContent": "Azure confidential virtual machines include all of the features of Trusted Launch and more. Trusted Launch allows administrators to deploy virtual machines with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and drivers. Trusted launch protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques. Trusted Launch is composed of several, coordinated infrastructure technologies that can be enabled independently. Each technology provides another layer of defense against sophisticated threats. By leveraging secure and measured boot, administrators gain insights and confidence of the entire boot chain's integrity. By using Azure confidential computing, you will utilize AMD processors with SEV-SNP technology. Confidential VMs are for tenants with high security, confidentiality, and integrity requirements. These VMs provide a strong, hardware-enforced boundary to help meet your security needs. You can use confidential VMs for migrations without making changes to your code, with the platform protecting your VM's state from being read or modified.",
